###ABSTRACT
How has the number of NFL players from each SEC school on 53-man rosters changed over time (e.g., 2011–2015, 2016–2020, and 2021–2025), and which schools have shown the most growth or decline in player representation?**

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Read the Excel file
data <- read_excel("College Dataset.xlsx")

# Rename columns for clarity (based on the header)
colnames(data) <- c("Pos", "Player", "College_Stats", "AP1", "PB", "St", "wAV", "Ht", "Wt", "Yrs_Num", "Years_Range", "School")

# Extract the start year from Years_Range
data <- data %>%
  mutate(start_year = as.integer(sub("-.*", "", Years_Range)))

# Filter to keep players who started in 2011 or later
filtered_data <- data %>%
  filter(start_year >= 2011)

# Select only the specified columns
fixed_data <- filtered_data %>%
  select(Pos, Player, Yrs_Num, Years_Range, School)

# Rename columns as per user labels if desired
colnames(fixed_data) <- c("Position", "Player", "Years Played", "Years Played (From-To)", "School")

# View the selected data (or you can use write_excel_csv to save it)
head(fixed_data)
```
